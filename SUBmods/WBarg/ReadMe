Greetings ACE programmer!

This is my first attempt at producing a non-toy ACE subprogram library module.

The essential files are: WBarg.o and WBarg.h. Notice that WBarg.h here is NOT the same
as ACEinclude:WBarg.h! Its basic purpose is to provide external declarations to the
subprograms in WBarg.o. The latter is an object module that must be linked with a 
program wishing to use any of the subprograms externally declared in WBarg.h. Use the
simple "Make" shell script, eg. make test, for this purpose.

WBarg.o contains subprograms to handle Workbench arguments (as documented in ace.doc) 
and tooltypes (not provided before). There is also a function which returns true or
false depending upon whether the program was Workbench-launched.

The file WBarg.b contains the source code to WBarg.o.

The test files consist of:

	test		'..the executable (type: "Make" to get this file). 
	test.b
	test.info
	arg1.info
	arg2.info
	arg3.info

To see what the program does, create a temporary drawer from the Workbench, copy
these files into it and experiment. See the comments at the top of test.b for more.

After playing with the program, go take a look at the source files: WBarg.b, WBarg.h,
test.b (probably in the reverse of that order).

I'll admit that creating subprogram library modules is not as straightforward as
it should be right now. I'm working on it though. At least _using_ them is fairly
easy given the appropriate ".h" file.

All comments are welcome.
