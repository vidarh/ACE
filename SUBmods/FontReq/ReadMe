This is the second subprogram library module I've created for serious use
(the first was WBarg which started life as an include file).

It encapsulates the functionality of an ASL file requester and was originally
created for use with my ReqEd utility. It can of course be used by any program.

Since ASL.library is required, Wb 2.x or higher is necessary to use this module.

See test.b for an example of how to use the font requester subprogram. Type "Make"
to generate the "test" executable.

You should also read the comments at the top of FontReq.h.

This module may be enhanced in the future (see Changes file).
