FontReq Subprogram Library Module - Changes
-------------------------------------------

13/2/95		-	Fixed a silent bug in which the TAG_DONE entry was
			missing from the TagItems array passed to AllocAslRequest().

5/3/95		-	ACE now allows _EXIT_PROG to be externally referenced by
			SUBmods obviating the need for the kludgy workaround
			(EXTERNAL _EXIT_PROG and inline assembly "xdef _EXIT_PROG"
			used in the first two versions of FontReq.o).
