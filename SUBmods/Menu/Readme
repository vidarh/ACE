Here's a SUBmod to give you easy access to GadTools menus, including submenus and
menu item separator bars.

Menu event trapping and menu waiting may be used as normal with this SUBmod, and
calling ACE's MENU(2) function will return the submenu item if any.

Copy Menu.h to ACEinclude:SUBmods, and type "make test" to compile the example
program.
