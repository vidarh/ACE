This SUBmod is an adaptation of ACE code written by Nils Sjoholm to provide an 
alternative to ACE's limited MsgBox function/statement via an Intuition library 
EasyRequester.

To create an executable which incorporates this SUBmod's functionality, type:

	bas -O YourPrgName EasyRequest.o

or use the supplied Make file. See also the provided example program, test.b.

Note that the code in EasyRequest.h is necessary when using this SUBmod as
shown by the #include line in test.b. Place this file in your ACEinclude:
directory.

If you wish to change the SUBmod code (in EasyRequest.b) and recompile it, you 
will need to have intuition.bmap in your ACEbmaps: directory.

Thanks goes to Nisse for his code. Enjoy!
