        listbox:

                This one is David's work. He put it up on
                the list a long time ago.

                I have made a few changes to this one.

                It's font sensitive.
                It adjusts its size after the longest string.
                It opens where the mouse is.

                Plus it's using my tagmacros and the new
                function declarations.

                Yeah it also use the new headers.

Note
----
ListBox.o is a Subprogram Library Module (SUBmod), so compile 
test.b as normal but also link with ListBox.o, ie.

	bas -O test ListBox.o

or use newbas (whichever uses ACPP, not APP)
or whatever you're bas script is called.

Make sure you have placed ListBox.h in ACE:include/SUBmods.
