This directory contains the primary executables (and then some) for compiling 
ACE programs. There are two preprocessors: APP and ACPP. The former is the 
original ACE preprocessor, while the latter is a C-style preprocessor which 
permits inclusion of more complex header files (see ACE:Include directory).
