Greetings ACERs.

This is a fairly complete double-precision floating point library suitable 
for use with ACE and C. Note that the C source module dp_val.c was compiled with 
Sozobon C to produce dp_val.o.

The best way to get a handle on the library's functionality is to try out the
test.b program (type "make test"), look through dp.h, and maybe even dp_main.s 
and dp_val.c.

The only important thing missing is a routine to output double-precision 
floating point numbers. There is however a routine to extract them from
strings.

If you can lay your hands on C source code for taking an IEEE DP value
and converting it to a printable string, I'd appreciate it if you'd pass
it along to me. It would save me some time.

This code will ultimately be used as the basis for the run-time side of 
ACE DOUBLEs.

Please test these routines and report any bugs to me at ace@vision.net.au.
I've done minimal testing but it all looks okay.

Enjoy!
