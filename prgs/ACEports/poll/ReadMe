ACE Message Ports
-----------------

The programs in this directory illustrate the use of ACE's new interprocess
communication capability.

They are the same as the programs in the ACEports directory with the
exception that message ports are polled in order to read a message, rather
than using the (nicer) message WAITing technique. This is typically used for
processes which can't afford to block on a port until a message arrives.

The easiest way to test them is to compile both programs from a shell and 
then type:

		run reader
followed by:
		writer

Alternatively you can type:

		run writer
then:
		reader

Another way is to copy each program to the RAM: disk (for example), compiling
both with the -i switch to create icons. Then open the RAM: disk and double
click on each program's icon. Either program may be run first.

See ace.doc and ref.doc for more information.
