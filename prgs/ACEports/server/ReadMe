ACE Message Ports: client/server example
-----------------

The programs in this directory illustrate the use of ACE's new interprocess
communication capability. In particular they demonstrate the client/server
principle.

The easiest way to test them is to copy both programs to the RAM: disk and 
compile both with the -i switch to create icons. Then open the RAM: disk and 
double click on the server's icon. More than one client can then be run. Type 
HELP in a client's window to find out what commands are recognised by the server.

See ace.doc and ref.doc for more information about ACE message ports.
