ACE Message Ports
-----------------

The programs in this directory illustrate the use of ACE's new interprocess
communication capability.

The easiest way to test them is to compile both programs from the shell and 
then type:

		run reader
followed by:
		writer

Alternatively you can type:

		run writer
then:
		reader

Another way is to copy each program to the RAM: disk (for example), compiling
both with the -i switch to create icons. Then open the RAM: disk and double
click on each program's icon. Either program may be run first.

See ace.doc and ref.doc for more information.
