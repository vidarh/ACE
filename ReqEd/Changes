ReqEd - Changes
===============

Version 1.1
-----------

13/2/95	-	Fixed a silent bug in which the TAG_DONE entry in FontReq.b 
		was missing from the TagItems array passed to AllocAslRequest().

	-	Code generated for text rendering is now placed in a multi-
		statement so as to reduce length of SUB.

14/2/95	-	Dirty bit is now set when the requester window is moved
		to a different location on the screen. This allows a save 
		to occur when "Save..." is selected from the Project menu.

18/2/95	-	Added cross-hair mouse pointer to main window when active.

19/2/95	-	Implemented bevel-boxes (raised and recessed) as tool bar
		objects.

	-	When modifying a gadget's text, default value or max. slider
		value, the previous is shown in the InputBox as the default.

	-	Max. slider value entry now loops until the value is > 0
		rather than the POTX/Y gadget disappearing from the window
		when the value is 0. This also prevents negative values from
		being entered (this should have been handled before).


Version 1.11
------------

20/2/95	-	Version 1.1 was released after testing on an A1200 and A3000
		without incident. However, ReqEd was shortly thereafter found
		to crash an A500 when the tool bar window was selected from the
		Project menu: the window failed to render because after the 
		addition of plateau and panel layout object buttons, the tool 
		bar window exceeded the height of the screen on my A500. The 
		solution was to decrease the height of each button by one
		vertical font height. Subsequent code assumes the existence
		of the tool bar window.

Version 1.12
------------

12/9/96	- 	More leading space added to menu items to better accomodate
		checkmarks for certain fonts.
