     NAME
          ab2ascii - generate ASCII source from AmigaBASIC binaries

     SYNOPSIS
          ab2ascii [options] [-o|>] [outfile] [<] [infiles]

     DESCRIPTION
          ab2ascii reads binary AmigaBASIC sources, expands tokens and
          symbols and generates ASCII output.  Today there is need for
          ab2ascii since AmigaBASIC does not run anymore under versions
          of Kickstart V37+.  ab2ascii should do exactly the same as
          the AmigaBASIC equivalent

                            SAVE "filename",A

          In fact many interresting AmigaBASIC programs have been
          published in the past and they should not be lost.

          By default ab2ascii converts from the standard input stream
          to the stdout, i.e. you can convert your binaries through
          a pipe.  If any input filenames are given in the command line
          these will be used instead of stdin.

          Input and output filename can NOT be the same.  However the output
          filename can be given relative to the input filename by using
          one `%s' construct in the ouput filename specification.  The first
          occurence of `%s' will be replaced by the input filename.
          A constant output filename makes no sense with more than one input
          file because ab2ascii would replace this file each time a new input
          file is converted.  To join several input files to one output file
          the standard output stream can be used.

          White spaces between the option keywords and their values are
          optional, i.e. `-ofile' and `-o file' are both legal, concatenation
          of option keywords however is not:  -vh and -v -h result in a quite
          different behaviour.


          Further options are:

          -d#      Sets the debugging level.  (currently -d1 only)
                   ab2ascii must be compiled w/ a symbol DEBUG defined to use
                   this option.

          -E file  Directs error messages to `file' instead of the standard
                   error stream 'stderr'.  Usefull for batchfiles

          -h       Displays a short usage information and option overview.

          -o fmt   Directs ASCII output to a file `fmt'.  The first `%s' in
                   fmt (if any) will be replaced by the input filename.
                   If the input is taken from stdin then `stdin' will be
                   used to replace `%s'

          -v       Displays short author and version information


     NOTES
          ab2ascii will not check the existance of the output file.
          If it exists ab2ascii will blow it away without asking you.
          ab2ascii also assumes the existance of all dircetories in the
          output path.

          For those who want to generate an ABASIC DOpus class:
          AmigaBASIC binaries always start with a $F5 byte!
