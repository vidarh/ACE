Installation
------------
Installing ACE consists of:

	- Unpacking the archive.

	- Adding a few commands to your s:user-startup (Wb 2.x/3.x) or 
	  s:startup-sequence (Wb 1.3) file.

First create a new drawer (eg. ACE) on your hard disk, open a shell window, 
change to the new directory, and unpack the archive into it with:

	lha -a x <archive-name>

eg.	lha -a x ace24.lha
	
The "-a" switch preserves file attributes (eg. the "s" bit on shell scripts) 
in the archive.

As you can see, it is *assumed* that you have a hard disk. If you don't, 
unpack the ACE archive into the RAM disk and place the contents of the 
distribution onto more than one floppy disk from there.

Next, add the following lines to your user-startup or startup-sequence 
script:

	assign ACE: <volume or directory>
	path ACE:bin add
 
where <volume or directory> is the name of the disk or directory where
the main ACE files now reside (eg: assign ACE: sys:ACE).

In addition, you need to add three more statements to your startup-sequence
or user-startup script:

	assign ACElib:	   ACE:lib	 ; bas finds scanned libraries here.
	assign ACEbmaps:   ACE:bmaps     ; ace looks here for .bmap files.
	assign ACEinclude: ACE:include	 ; app uses this for include files.

Now reboot your Amiga to let the above path and assign commands take effect.

That's it!
