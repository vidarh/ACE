The contents of this directory are subject to change.

Some header files (eg. fexists.h) here may become subprogram library modules 
(SUBmods). In general, those which define useful subprograms are likely to be 
so converted. 

The contents of other headers are likely to be expanded in the future, eg. 
acedef.h.
